<h1> An Dramatically Innovative Chart or A Misleading One?  </h1>
By Luo Huiwen
<div>
<p>Issues related to gun shooting deaths are always hot potato for the U.S. society, therefore, related laws could usually hit the sensitive nerves of the "Stand Your Ground" law has once aroused big controversy.</p>
</div>
<p>Reuters have once published a <a href=” https://www.inside.com.tw/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/07.jpg” >chart</a> as shown below (the original link seems to lose the graphic now)</p>
<div>
<p>At first glance without careful attention, one might easily be misled by the change of statistics of gun deaths in Florida in a reverse way since the Y-axis of the chart is reversed upside down – the lowest numerical value "0" is on the above and the highest numerical value "800" is at the bottom, which is quite to the opposite of one’s viewing and cognitive habits.</p>

<p>According to the original report from <a href="http://ttp//www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-florida-shooting-dunn-idUSBREA1E0MR20140216">Reuter</a> and the graphic itself, the graphic seems to intend to show the relationship between the enactment of the "Stand Your Ground" law since 2005 and change in statistics of the gun deaths in Florida. Some experts stated criticism and concern on the enactment of the law since they thought that the law, to some extent, potentially encourage gun shooting. According to the graphic, gun deaths in Florida did sharply rise in the following two years since the implementation of the law.</p>

<p>However, according to the graphic shown, the statistics since 2005 fluctuated – first sharply rises, then decreases before rising. There's not one clear and same-direction change shown since 2005; furthermore, it is difficult to foresee and predict the time taken for the actual effects of the law to reveal in Florida. Therefore, it’s not evident enough to draw the conclusion that the law leads to higher gun deaths in Florida.</p>

<p>Perhaps the author intends to create a dramatic effects using this trick, however, the change is not that dramatic on the graph since the X-axis cover the statistics from 1990s to 2010s, the time span of which is much longer than the total of respectively threefold five years before and afterthought implementation of the law. What is much clearer is the peak - relatively lower numerical values during late 1990s and early 2000s; in a word, the emphasis of the graphic is ambiguous. Furthermore, the numeric value on the Y-axis is reversed, one could easily take the change of the statistics in a reverse way. Although it might literally create some unexpected dramatic results, it might add to difficulty for one to change the thinking and viewing logic to understand the essence of the graphic. It is undoubtedly that one of the most important advantage of data visualization is to make people understand statistics much more easily. However, the author of this graphic seems to make things more rather difficult.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Last but not least, even if the graphic tends to show the relationship between the implementation of the law and the change of gun deaths statistics, the reason supporting such could-be relationship might be more complex. For example, the sales of guns, people who own guns, etc.</p>
